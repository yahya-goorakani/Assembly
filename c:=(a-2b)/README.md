# Assembly Code README

This assembly code is designed to calculate the value of `c` according to the formula `c := a - 2 * b`.

## Overview

- `a`, `b`, and `c` are defined as bytes in the data segment.
- The program displays the result of the calculation along with a message indicating what the result represents.
- It also includes newline characters for formatting.
- The program then exits.

## Code Explanation

### Data Segment
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are defined as bytes to hold numerical values.
- `result_msg` holds the message that will be displayed along with the calculated result.
- `newline` contains newline characters for formatting.

### Code Segment
- The program begins by setting up the data segment.
- It moves the value of `a` into the `AL` register.
- The value of `b` is moved into the `AH` register.
- The program then doubles the value of `b` by adding `AH` to itself.
- It subtracts the doubled value of `b` (stored in `AH`) from `AL`.
- The result (`AL`) is stored in `c`.
- Next, it displays the result message using DOS interrupt `21h` with function `09h`.
- Then, it converts the numerical value of `c` to ASCII and prints it.
- After printing the result, it prints newline characters for formatting.
- Finally, it exits the program using DOS interrupt `21h` with function `4Ch`.

## Running the Program

To run the program:
1. Assemble the code using an assembler like TASM or NASM.
2. Link the object file to create an executable.
3. Execute the generated executable.

## Expected Output

The program should display the result of the calculation `c := a - 2 * b` along with the message "The result is:", followed by a newline character.

## Example

For the provided data (`a = 9`, `b = 3`), the expected output would be:
